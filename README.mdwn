# Vimfiles

Most of this repository is respectfully stolen from Ian Langworth's excellent article [Vim After 15
Years|https://statico.github.io/vim3.html]. I've tried to adopt only the features I understand and
am currently getting used to so it is not a verbatim copy of [Ian's
repository|https://github.com/statico/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/vimrc].

## Initial Installation

1. Set up Vundle
1. Clone into `~/.vim`
1. Symlink `.vimrc` into your home directory: `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
1. Open Vim and do `:source %` followed by `:PluginInstall`
